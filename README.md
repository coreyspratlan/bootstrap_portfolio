Bootstrap Portfolio

Components from Bootstrap where arranged and ammended to produce this homework assigment.  

A Navbar was placed in three HTML files linking them together with the following page names:

  1.  About Me
  2.  Portfolio
  3.  Contact

In the head tags of each HTML file, a link was provided to Bootstraps library of code, as well as a meta tag for multi-device responsive layouts.  A JavaScript link was also provided so that different options for functionality changed between devices.

A CSS Stylesheet was linked to each of the HTML files for astetic layout design.  Colors were matched throughout for uniformity.

Each of the page layouts were designed with the CSS Grid.

I have adjusted some of the margins in the card bodies for text aesthetics.  I adjusted the About Me conainer margins to better fit the page.  I adjusted the size of card form so the content better fits the page.  I added a few semantic tags to my html documents for better organization.
